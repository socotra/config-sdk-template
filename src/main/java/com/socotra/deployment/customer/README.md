Develop plugin code in this directory since plugins must belong to the `com.socotra.deployment.customer` namespace, and following Java directory path conventions allows the Config SDK plugin and IDE tools to provide various assistance facilities (e.g. entity recognition, auto-complete, etc.).

Plugin code that is ready for deployment should be placed in the `socotra-config/plugins/java` or appropriate product-specific plugin directory (`plugins/java` in the `products/<productName>` directory).
